# Kâ€™th Non-repeating Character in Python using List Comprehension and OrderedDict

# Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 3
# Output : r
# First non-repeating character is f,
# second is o and third is r.
#
# Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 2
# Output : o
#
# Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 4
# Output : Less than k non-repeating
#          characters in input.

# OrderedDict returns a dictionary data
        # structure having characters of input

# string as keys in the same order they
